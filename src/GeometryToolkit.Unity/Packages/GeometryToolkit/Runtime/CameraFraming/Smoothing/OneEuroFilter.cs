    /// Cutoff frequency adapts to the input's instantaneous speed: low cutoff at rest
    /// (heavy smoothing — micro-jitter is suppressed) and higher cutoff during fast
    /// motion (light smoothing — minimal lag). This trade-off cannot be made by a
    /// fixed-cutoff low-pass filter, which always picks one or the other.
    ///
    /// Reference implementation: <see href="http://cristal.univ-lille.fr/~casiez/1euro/"/>
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Tuning guide:
    ///   - <see cref="MinCutoff"/>: lower → smoother at rest. Start at 1.0 Hz; drop to ~0.5 Hz
    ///     if idle jitter is still visible.
    ///   - <see cref="Beta"/>: higher → tighter tracking during fast motion. Start at 0.007;
    ///     raise to ~0.02 if fast moves feel laggy.
    ///   - <see cref="DerivativeCutoff"/>: low-pass cutoff applied to the speed estimate.
    ///     1.0 Hz is the canonical default and rarely needs changing.
    ///
    /// State retention: the filter persists `_xPrev` / `_dxPrev` across calls. Call
    /// <see cref="Reset"/> when the underlying signal jumps discontinuously (target
    /// switch, teleport) so the speed estimate doesn't carry over the artifact.
